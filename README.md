# hirst-painting
This project recreates a digital version of a Damien Hirst-inspired dot painting using Python's Turtle graphics library. The program generates a colorful, abstract artwork composed of evenly spaced dots in a grid pattern, mimicking Hirst's iconic style.

Features
Automated Drawing: The Turtle module is used to automate the drawing of dots in various colors and sizes, creating a vibrant, randomized dot pattern.
Color Randomization: Each dot is filled with a randomly selected color, ensuring a unique and visually dynamic composition every time the program runs.
Grid Layout: The dots are positioned on a grid, maintaining a structured yet artistic layout reminiscent of Hirst's famous spot paintings.
Purpose
This project is a fun way to explore Python's Turtle graphics library while creating a visually appealing piece of digital art. It's an excellent exercise for those looking to learn about loops, randomization, and basic graphics programming in Python.
